JavaScript OOP Code Challenge
Challenge: Smart Restaurant Ordering System
A restaurant company wants to modernize its ordering software.

Currently, the restaurant offers different types of meals to customers, such as 
burgers, pizzas, and salads. Even though all meals share common characteristics,
 each meal behaves differently when calculating its final preparation details 
 and customer message.

As a software developer, your task is to build a system using
 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with inheritance and 
 polymorphism in JavaScript.

Your goal is to design a flexible system that avoids duplicated code and allows 
the restaurant to easily add more meal types in the future.

---

Business Scenario
The restaurant has discovered that:

All meals have common information.
Every meal can display its information.
Every meal can calculate a final preparation message.
However, each meal type behaves differently.

For example:

A burger may require grilling instructions.

A pizza may require baking instructions.

A salad may require fresh ingredient preparation.

Even though all meal types perform a similar action, the result is different 
depending on the meal.

This is where polymorphism becomes important.

---

Requirements
Create a Parent Class
Create a parent class called:

Meal


The class must contain the following properties:

name
price
category

Example:

Name: Pepperoni Pizza
Price: $25
Category: Pizza


---

Add Methods to the Parent Class
Create a method called:

showInformation()


This method must display the meal information.

---

Create another method called:

prepareMeal()
This method must exist in the parent class.

However:

At the parent level, it should only display a generic message.

Example:

Preparing meal...


---

Create Child Classes
Create the following child classes:

Burger
The class must inherit from Meal.

Add a new property:

hasCheese

Override the method:

prepareMeal()


Example output:

Grilling the burger and preparing ingredients.


---

Pizza
The class must inherit from Meal.

Add a new property:

size

Override the method:

prepareMeal()


Example output:

Baking the pizza in the oven.


---

Salad
The class must inherit from Meal.

Add a new property:

dressing

Override the method:

prepareMeal()
Example output:

Preparing fresh vegetables and adding dressing.


---

Create Objects
Create at least:

One Burger object
One Pizza object
One Salad object

You may choose your own values.

---

Store the Objects in an Array
Create an array called:

menu


The array must contain all created meal objects.

Example idea:

const menu = [burger, pizza, salad];


---

Apply Polymorphism
Loop through the array.

For every meal object:

Display the information.
Call:

prepareMeal()


Important:

You must use the same method call for every object.

Example idea:

meal.prepareMeal();


However, the behavior should automatically change depending on the object type.

This is the core objective of the challenge.

---

Rules
You must use:

Classes
Constructors
Objects
Inheritance (extends)
super()
Method overriding
Polymorphism
Arrays
Loops

---
Restrictions
Do NOT:

Repeat the same code unnecessarily.
Create completely separate unrelated classes.
Use if or switch to determine meal behavior.

The behavior must happen naturally using polymorphism.

---

Expected Learning Goals
By completing this challenge, students should understand:

How inheritance reduces duplicated code
How child classes inherit behavior
How method overriding works
How polymorphism changes behavior dynamically
How to design scalable software systems
Why OOP is useful for real-world applications

---

Hints
Hint 1
Ask yourself:

Is a pizza a meal?

If yes, inheritance probably makes sense.

---

Hint 2
Think carefully about:

prepareMeal()


The method should exist in multiple classes.

But should every class implement it the same way?

---

Hint 3
The magic of polymorphism happens when:

someObject.prepareMeal();


calls different behaviors automatically.

---

Bonus Challenge
If you finish early:

Add a new class called Dessert.
Add a property called preparationTime.
Add a method called calculateDiscount().
Display all meals using a looped restaurant menu system.
Add a customer order simulation.
